## Content

R code used for all the numerical analyses presented in Lavergne et al. (https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.16314). The isotope-derived and predicted ci/ca data over the 1951-2014 period are provided here in 5-year boxcar averages, along with the environmental data. The implementation of the model in R is available via the R package rpmodel (https://github.com/stineb/rpmodel; Stocker et al. in revision).
